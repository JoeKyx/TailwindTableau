# TailwindTableau

TailwindCSS style extension for Tableau. 

Inspired by and a fork of [TabCSS](https://github.com/FsuLauncherComp/BootstrapTableau)

## Usage

1. Add the extension as floating to your workbook
2. All Tableau objects that should be influenced have to be positioned in front of the extension (you can create one floating container, position it infront of the extension, and put your objects in there)
3. Style your objects by editing their name, everything behind a bar (|) will be added as tailwind classes to the object example: KPI Container|rounded-b-lg z-3 shadow-lg bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-100 to-slate-50

More detailed usage with example to follow
